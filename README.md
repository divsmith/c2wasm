## [→ Try the Live Demo](https://divsmith.github.io/c2wasm/)

Write C in the browser. Click **Compile & Run**. See the output instantly — no servers, no plugins, no waiting. Everything happens in your browser tab.

---

## What is this?

c2wasm is a complete C compiler written in a curated subset of C — and that subset is exactly what the compiler itself can compile. This makes it **self-hosting**: the compiler can compile its own source code.

The browser demo shows the full pipeline:

```
C source  →  [c2wasm compiler]  →  WAT (WebAssembly Text)  →  [wabt.js]  →  WASM binary  →  runs in browser
```

Everything runs client-side. The compiler itself was compiled to a 229 KB WASM binary using [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) (standard WASI target).

---

## Features

- **Write C in the browser** — Monaco editor with C syntax highlighting, error markers, and Ctrl+Enter to compile
- **Instant output** — see your program's console output in the same tab
- **WAT inspector** — view the generated WebAssembly Text Format to see exactly what the compiler emitted
- **Your own files** — create new C files, edit them freely, and they persist in your browser's local storage across sessions
- **Built-in examples** — Hello World, Fibonacci, Linked List traversal, and Bubble Sort to get started
- **Self-hosting** — the compiler is written in the same C subset it compiles; see `tools/bootstrap.sh` for the 3-stage verification

---

## Supported C Subset

c2wasm supports a carefully chosen subset of C89/C90:

| Feature | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Types | `int`, `char`, `void`, `T*`, `T[N]`, `struct { ... }` |
| Literals | Integer (decimal/hex), character, string |
| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` |
| Comparison | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` |
| Logical | `&&`, `\|\|`, `!` |
| Assignment | `=`, `+=`, `-=` |
| Pointer ops | `*` (deref), `&` (address-of), `[]` (subscript), `.`, `->` |
| Prefix | `++`, `--`, cast `(T)` |
| Statements | `if`/`else`, `while`, `for`, `return`, `break`, `continue` |
| Functions | Recursion, forward declarations |
| Built-ins | `malloc`, `free` (no-op), `exit`, `putchar`, `getchar`, `printf` (`%d %s %c %x`) |
| Preprocessor | `#define NAME integer-literal` only |

All types map to `i32` internally. No `float`, no `double`.

## How It Works

### Compiler Pipeline (inside `compiler/src/c2wasm.c`)

```
Source text
    │
    ▼
┌─────────┐
│  Lexer  │  Tokenizes: identifiers, keywords, numbers, strings, operators
└────┬────┘
     │ Token stream
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│  Parser  │  Recursive descent; Pratt-style expression precedence
└────┬─────┘
     │ AST
     ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Type Checker │  Resolves symbols, computes struct field offsets, annotates AST
└────┬─────────┘
     │ Typed AST
     ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Code Gen     │  Single-pass WAT emission; printf lowered to putchar calls
└────┬─────────┘
     │ WAT text
     ▼
  stdout
```

### Browser Integration

- **Compiler → WASM**: compiled with [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) to a standalone 229 KB `.wasm` file (no JavaScript runtime bundled)
- **Stdin/stdout redirection**: a minimal WASI shim (`compiler-api.js`) feeds C source as stdin bytes and captures WAT from stdout
- **WAT → WASM binary**: [wabt.js](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) assembles WAT to a binary in the browser
- **Execution**: `WebAssembly.instantiate` with a WASI shim; `fd_write`/`fd_read` capture stdout and supply pre-buffered stdin; programs using `getchar` read from the stdin input box in the demo UI

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| All types → `i32` | Maximum simplicity; supports all example programs |
| Output WAT, not binary | WAT is readable; lets you see exactly what the compiler did |
| `printf` lowered at compile time | Format strings expanded to `putchar` calls; no variadic WASM needed |
| Bump allocator, `free` is a no-op | Sufficient for the C subset; keeps codegen simple |
| Single-file compiler | Maximizes self-hosting elegance; 2,800 lines of C |

## Self-Hosting Verification

The compiler can compile itself. `tools/bootstrap.sh` performs a 3-stage bootstrap:

```
Stage 1: GCC compiles c2wasm.c → native binary (s1)
Stage 2: s1 compiles c2wasm.c → WAT → WASM (s2)
Stage 3: s2 compiles c2wasm.c → WAT (s3.wat)

diff s1.wat s3.wat  ← must be empty
```

A clean diff proves that the compiler, when run inside WebAssembly, produces byte-for-byte identical output to the GCC-compiled version.

## Local Development

There are **two separate binaries** in this project:

| Binary | What it is | How to build |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `build/c2wasm` | Native compiler (for running tests) | `cd compiler && make` |
| `demo/compiler.wasm` | Browser compiler (for the demo) | `WASI_SDK=... make wasm` |

`demo/compiler.wasm` is gitignored — a fresh clone won't have it. You only need to rebuild it if you're working on the demo or changed the compiler and want to update the deployed binary.

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Required for |
|------|-------------|
| GCC | Building the native compiler |
| `wat2wasm` + `wasmtime` | Running tests and bootstrap |
| [wasi-sdk v25](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-25) | Rebuilding `demo/compiler.wasm` |
| Python 3 | `make serve` |

Install wasi-sdk from the [releases page](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-25):
```bash
# macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
curl -LO https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-25/wasi-sdk-25.0-arm64-macos.tar.gz
tar xzf wasi-sdk-25.0-arm64-macos.tar.gz
sudo mv wasi-sdk-25.0-arm64-macos /opt/wasi-sdk

# macOS x86_64 (Intel)
curl -LO https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-25/wasi-sdk-25.0-x86_64-macos.tar.gz
tar xzf wasi-sdk-25.0-x86_64-macos.tar.gz
sudo mv wasi-sdk-25.0-x86_64-macos /opt/wasi-sdk

# Linux x86_64
curl -LO https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-25/wasi-sdk-25.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
tar xzf wasi-sdk-25.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
sudo mv wasi-sdk-25.0-x86_64-linux /opt/wasi-sdk
```

### Build the native compiler

```bash
cd compiler
make           # builds build/c2wasm from src/c2wasm.c
make clean     # force a clean rebuild next time
```

> `make` prints `Nothing to be done for 'all'` when `build/c2wasm` is already up to date — that's correct. Run `make clean && make` to force a full rebuild.

### Run the tests

Requires `wat2wasm` and `wasmtime` on `PATH`:

```bash
cd compiler
make test      # runs all 39 test programs + bootstrap self-hosting check
make bootstrap # run the 3-stage bootstrap check alone
```

### Rebuild the browser compiler

Only needed when you change `compiler/src/c2wasm.c` and want to update the demo:

```bash
# With wasi-sdk at /opt/wasi-sdk (default):
cd compiler && make wasm

# With wasi-sdk elsewhere:
cd compiler && WASI_SDK=/path/to/wasi-sdk make wasm
# produces demo/compiler.wasm (229 KB)
```

### Serve the demo locally

```bash
cd compiler && make serve
# open http://localhost:8080
```

> `make serve` uses `demo/server.py` instead of `python3 -m http.server` because the demo requires
> `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` headers to enable `SharedArrayBuffer`
> (interactive stdin). On GitHub Pages these headers are injected by `demo/coi-serviceworker.js`.

### Test Programs

`compiler/tests/programs/` contains 39 progressive test programs, from basic returns through structs, strings, switch/case, enums, typedef, and array initializers.

## Contributing

The compiler is intentionally written in its own supported subset — if you add a language feature, you must be able to write the implementation using only features the compiler already supports.

Issues and PRs welcome.

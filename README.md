**A self-hosting C compiler that targets WebAssembly, running entirely in your browser.**

## [→ Try the Live Demo](https://divsmith.github.io/c2wasm/)

Write C in the browser. Click **Compile & Run**. See the output instantly — no servers, no plugins, no waiting. Everything happens in your browser tab.

---

## What is this?

c2wasm is a complete C compiler written in a curated subset of C — and that subset is exactly what the compiler itself can compile. This makes it **self-hosting**: the compiler can compile its own source code.

The browser demo shows the full pipeline:

```
C source  →  [c2wasm compiler]  →  WAT (WebAssembly Text)  →  [wabt.js]  →  WASM binary  →  runs in browser
```

Everything runs client-side. The compiler itself was compiled to a 229 KB WASM binary using [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) (standard WASI target).

---

## Features

- **Write C in the browser** — Monaco editor with C syntax highlighting, error markers, and Ctrl+Enter to compile
- **Instant output** — see your program's console output in the same tab
- **WAT inspector** — view the generated WebAssembly Text Format to see exactly what the compiler emitted
- **Your own files** — create new C files, edit them freely, and they persist in your browser's local storage across sessions
- **Built-in examples** — Hello World, Fibonacci, Linked List traversal, and Bubble Sort to get started
- **Self-hosting** — the compiler is written in the same C subset it compiles; see `tools/bootstrap.js` for the 3-stage verification

## Supported C Subset

c2wasm supports a carefully chosen subset of C89/C90:

| Feature | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Types | `int`, `char`, `void`, `T*`, `T[N]`, `struct { ... }` |
| Literals | Integer (decimal/hex), character, string |
| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` |
| Comparison | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` |
| Logical | `&&`, `\|\|`, `!` |
| Assignment | `=`, `+=`, `-=` |
| Pointer ops | `*` (deref), `&` (address-of), `[]` (subscript), `.`, `->` |
| Prefix | `++`, `--`, cast `(T)` |
| Statements | `if`/`else`, `while`, `for`, `return`, `break`, `continue` |
| Functions | Recursion, forward declarations |
| Built-ins | `malloc`, `free` (no-op), `exit`, `putchar`, `getchar`, `printf` (`%d %s %c %x`) |
| Preprocessor | `#define NAME integer-literal` only |

All types map to `i32` internally. No `float`, no `double`.

## How It Works

### Compiler Pipeline (inside `compiler/src/c2wasm.c`)

```
Source text
    │
    ▼
┌─────────┐
│  Lexer  │  Tokenizes: identifiers, keywords, numbers, strings, operators
└────┬────┘
     │ Token stream
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│  Parser  │  Recursive descent; Pratt-style expression precedence
└────┬─────┘
     │ AST
     ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Type Checker │  Resolves symbols, computes struct field offsets, annotates AST
└────┬─────────┘
     │ Typed AST
     ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Code Gen     │  Single-pass WAT emission; printf lowered to putchar calls
└────┬─────────┘
     │ WAT text
     ▼
  stdout
```

### Browser Integration

- **Compiler → WASM**: compiled with [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) to a standalone 229 KB `.wasm` file (no JavaScript runtime bundled)
- **Stdin/stdout redirection**: a minimal WASI shim (`compiler-api.js`) feeds C source as stdin bytes and captures WAT from stdout
- **WAT → WASM binary**: [wabt.js](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) assembles WAT to a binary in the browser
- **Execution**: `WebAssembly.instantiate` with a WASI shim; `fd_write`/`fd_read` capture stdout and supply pre-buffered stdin; programs using `getchar` read from the stdin input box in the demo UI

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| All types → `i32` | Maximum simplicity; supports all example programs |
| Output WAT, not binary | WAT is readable; lets you see exactly what the compiler did |
| `printf` lowered at compile time | Format strings expanded to `putchar` calls; no variadic WASM needed |
| Bump allocator, `free` is a no-op | Sufficient for the C subset; keeps codegen simple |
| Single-file compiler | Maximizes self-hosting elegance; 2,800 lines of C |

## Self-Hosting Verification

The compiler can compile itself. `tools/bootstrap.js` performs a 3-stage bootstrap:

```
Stage 1: GCC compiles c2wasm.c → native binary (s1)
Stage 2: s1 compiles c2wasm.c → WAT → WASM (s2)
Stage 3: s2 compiles c2wasm.c → WAT (s3.wat)

diff s1.wat s3.wat  ← must be empty
```

A clean diff proves that the compiler, when run inside WebAssembly, produces byte-for-byte identical output to the GCC-compiled version.

> Both shell-based (`bootstrap.sh`) and Node.js-based (`bootstrap.js`) bootstrap scripts are provided. `make test` automatically picks whichever toolchain is available.

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- GCC (for native build)
- **Node.js ≥ 18** + `npm install` — for test runner and bootstrap (uses [wabt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wabt) npm package)
- Python 3 (for `make serve`)
- [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) — only needed to rebuild `compiler.wasm`

> **Legacy toolchain:** `wat2wasm` + `wasmtime` still work — `make test` falls back to them automatically when Node.js/wabt aren't available.

### Build & Test

```bash
# Install test dependencies (one time)
npm install

# Build the native compiler
cd compiler
make

# Run the test suite (39 programs + bootstrap validation)
make test

# Rebuild the WASM compiler for the demo (requires wasi-sdk)
WASI_SDK=/path/to/wasi-sdk make wasm

# Legacy: rebuild with Emscripten instead
make wasm-emcc

# Serve the demo locally (sets required cross-origin isolation headers)
make serve
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

> **Note:** `make serve` uses `demo/server.py` (not plain `python3 -m http.server`) because the
> demo requires the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` HTTP headers
> to enable `SharedArrayBuffer`, which powers interactive stdin in the terminal.
> On GitHub Pages these headers are injected by `demo/coi-serviceworker.js`.

### Test Programs

`compiler/tests/programs/` contains 39 progressive test programs, from basic returns through structs, strings, switch/case, enums, typedef, and array initializers.

## Contributing

The compiler is intentionally written in its own supported subset — if you add a language feature, you must be able to write the implementation using only features the compiler already supports.

Issues and PRs welcome.
